karma-jasmine-amd-example
=====================

An example running jasmine tests with karma against AMD modules.

`karma.conf.js` and `test-main.js` were generated by running `karma init`.  Slight
modifications were made to `test-main.js` to properly configure require.

You can run the tests by doing one of the following:

1. `npm test`
2. `$(npm bin)/karma start`
3. `karma start` (requires `npm install -g karma-cli` first)
