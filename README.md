karma-jasmine-example
=====================

An example running jasmine and sinon in the browser via karma.

`karma.conf.js` and `test-main.js` were generated by running `karma init`.  Slight
modifications were made to `test-main.js` to properly configure require.

You can run karma by executing `$(npm bin)/karma start`, or you can `npm install -g karma-cli`
to add `karma` to your path.
